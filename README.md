# Pokemon Project / QA Learning Spring

### Description
During my work at this project I wanted to see and be familiar with how particular layers communicate with each other.
How information from client being transfered to database and back to the client. How to test spring applications and in overall
gather more experience in backend development. Stepping as a developer role was fun. I have built everything from scratch
which helped me to reach my goal.

### Tools, Frameworks:
* Java 17
* Spring Boot 3.2
* Spring Web - REST API
* Spring Data JPA

### For Testing purpose:
* H2 Database - unit tests
* JUnit 5
* Mockito

### Guides

This project hasn`t been finished yet. As this is my playground I will continuously add more functionalities 
and tests. If you want you can copy code and download SQL schema and try implement your solutions.
